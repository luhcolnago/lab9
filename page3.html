 			<p>The brigadeiro (Portuguese pronunciation: [bɾiga'dejɾu]) is a traditional Brazilian dessert, created by a confectioner from Rio de Janeiro, Heloisa Nabuco de Oliveira. It is made of condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and chocolate sprinkles covering the outside layer.</p><img src="././images/Brigadeiro.jpeg" alt="The Best Chocolate EVER!" class= "float-right">
 			<p>It is a popular confection throughout the country, especially for festive events. Brigadeiros are commonly made at home, and also found in bakeries and snack shops. A brigadeiro is generally shaped into small balls covered in chocolate sprinkles and placed in a small cupcake liner. The mixture may also be poured into a small container, and eaten with a spoon, and this is known as a brigadeiro de colher (literally, "spoon brigadeiro"). In recent years, flavor and coating variations on the traditional chocolate brigadeiros have become popular. This variation of flavors and easy manipulation of the original dessert lead into a trend of different recipes, such as cakes, tarts, ice cream or even bread. Brigadeiro can be found now in different countries as a result of Brazilian immigration.</p>
            <p>The origin of the name "Brigadeiro" is linked to the presidential campaign of Brigadier Eduardo Gomes, UDN candidate for the Presidency of the Republic in 1946. Heloísa Nabuco de Oliveira, a member of a traditional carioca family who supported the brigadeiro's candidacy, created a new confection, and named it for the candidate. The doce de brigadeiro (brigadier's sweet) became popular, and the name was eventually shortened to just "brigadeiro." Women at the time would sell brigadeiro in support of the presidential candidate as it was the first national election in which women were able to vote.[8] Despite the support received, Eduardo Gomes was defeated, and the election was won by then General Eurico Gaspar Dutra.</p>
